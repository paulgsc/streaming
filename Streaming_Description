### Title: Coding Stream - Building Landing Page

#### Description:
Welcome to my coding livestream! Today, we will be building a landing page from scratch, and I'll walk you through every step of the process. Our goal is to create a VPS/self-hosted site that runs intermittently to minimize costs and avoid paywalls. We're leveraging open-source tools and writing our own solutions where necessary to ensure complete freedom from service charges.

**Key Points:**
- **Purpose of the Site:** 
  We're creating a VPS/self-hosted website that operates on a schedule, minimizing operational costs and avoiding any paywalls. This project is entirely open-source, ensuring that we maintain control and transparency throughout the development process.
  
- **What We'll Cover:**
  - Setting up the project environment
  - Designing and coding the landing page layout
  - Implementing responsive design principles
  - Integrating open-source tools and libraries
  - Deploying the site using a VPS
